In Python, exception handling is a mechanism to deal with runtime errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during program execution. Exception handling allows you to gracefully manage errors, preventing your program from crashing unexpectedly.

Here's a brief overview of exception handling in Python:

1. **try-except block**: This is the basic structure for handling exceptions in Python. Code that might raise an exception is placed within the `try` block, and any exceptions that occur are caught and handled in the `except` block.

   ```python
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       # Handle the exception
       print("Error: Division by zero")
   ```

2. **Multiple except blocks**: You can have multiple `except` blocks to handle different types of exceptions.

   ```python
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       result = int("hello")  # This will raise a ValueError
   except ValueError:
       # Handle ValueError
       print("Error: Invalid conversion")
   except TypeError:
       # Handle TypeError
       print("Error: Type mismatch")
   ```

3. **else block**: The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised within the `try` block.

   ```python
   try:
       result = 10 / 2
   except ZeroDivisionError:
       print("Error: Division by zero")
   else:
       print("Result:", result)
   ```

4. **finally block**: The `finally` block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's commonly used for cleanup operations.

   ```python
   try:
       f = open("myfile.txt", "r")
       # Perform file operations
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("Error: File not found")
   finally:
       # Close the file, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
       f.close()
   ```

5. **Raising exceptions**: You can manually raise exceptions using the `raise` statement.

   ```python
   x = -1
   if x < 0:
       raise ValueError("Negative numbers are not allowed")
   ```

These are the basic constructs for handling exceptions in Python. Effective use of exception handling can make your code more robust and reliable.
