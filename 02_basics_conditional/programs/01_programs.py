# Sure! Here are 20 Python programs demonstrating various concepts related to conditional statements:

# 1. Program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero. >> done 

# 2. Program to find the maximum of three numbers. >> done 

# 3. Program to check if a year is a leap year or not. >> done 

# 4. Program to check if a character is a vowel or consonant. >> donw 

# 5. Program to find the largest among three numbers using nested if statements. >>done

# 6. Program to check if a number is prime or not. >> done

# 7. Program to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion. >> done 

# 8. Program to check if a string is a palindrome or not. >>done 

# 9. Program to check if a number is Armstrong or not. >>done 

# 10. Program to find the sum of natural numbers using while loop. >> done 

# 11. Program to find the sum of digits of a number using while loop.

# 12. Program to print Fibonacci series up to n terms.

# 13. Program to find the factorial of a number using for loop.

# 14. Program to print multiplication table of a number.

# 15. Program to find the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers.
# 16. Program to check if a number is a perfect number or not.
# 17. Program to reverse a number using while loop.
# 18. Program to check if a number is even or odd without using modulus operator.
# 19. Program to find the roots of a quadratic equation.
# 20. Program to find the area of a triangle given its sides.

# Each of these programs demonstrates various aspects of conditional statements in Python and will help in understanding and mastering the concepts. Let me know if you need any further explanation or assistance with any of these programs!
